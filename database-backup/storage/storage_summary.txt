Purpose: Product image storage
Status: Active but empty
Configuration:
- Public Access: Yes
- File Size Limit: 10 MB (10,485,760 bytes)
- Allowed File Types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif
- AVIF Auto-detection: Disabled
- Created: 2025-07-10 11:46:33 UTC
- Current Usage: 0 bytes (0 objects)

BUCKET 2: message-attachments
============================
Purpose: Message attachment storage (payment proofs, documents)
Status: Active with content
Configuration:
- Public Access: Yes
- File Size Limit: 10 MB (10,485,760 bytes)
- Allowed File Types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif, application/pdf
- AVIF Auto-detection: Disabled
- Created: 2025-07-10 11:46:33 UTC
- Current Usage: 629,372 bytes (8 objects)

================================================================================
STORAGE USAGE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

BY FILE TYPE:
- PDF Documents: 4 files (219,287 bytes / 214.1 KB)
- JPEG Images: 2 files (116,818 bytes / 114.1 KB)  
- PNG Images: 2 files (404,656 bytes / 395.2 KB)

BY USER:
- User c5d8ea1d-d801-4362-8150-7d605e7765fc: 2 files (118,938 bytes)
- User 130ec316-970f-429f-8cb8-ff9adf751248: 6 files (510,434 bytes)

USAGE PATTERN:
- All stored files are payment proof documents
- Naming convention: payment-proof-{user-id}-{timestamp}.{ext}
- Recent activity period: July 11-13, 2025
- File sizes range from 34KB to 370KB

================================================================================
STORAGE SECURITY & ACCESS
================================================================================

Security Model:
- All buckets are publicly accessible
- Files are identified by UUID-based object IDs
- Owner information is tracked per object
- Version control is enabled for all objects
- Cache control headers are set (max-age=3600)

Access Patterns:
- Direct URL access available for public buckets
- Files served with appropriate MIME types
- ETags provided for caching efficiency
- Last access timestamps tracked

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. USAGE MONITORING:
   - Current storage usage is minimal (614.6 KB)
   - Well within limits for both buckets
   - No immediate storage optimization needed

2. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - All buckets are public - ensure this meets security requirements
   - Consider implementing access controls for sensitive documents
   - Payment proof documents are publicly accessible

3. OPERATIONAL NOTES:
   - product-images bucket is unused - consider removing if not needed
   - message-attachments bucket actively used for payment proofs
   - File naming convention is consistent and includes user identification

4. FUTURE PLANNING:
   - Monitor storage growth as user base expands
   - Consider implementing file cleanup policies for old documents
   - Evaluate need for additional buckets based on feature requirements

SQL QUERIES USED FOR EXPORT
================================================================================

Bucket Information:
SELECT id, name, owner, created_at, updated_at, public, avif_autodetection, 
       file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types, owner_id 
FROM storage.buckets 
ORDER BY created_at;

Object Information:
SELECT id, bucket_id, name, owner, created_at, updated_at, last_accessed_at, 
       metadata, version, owner_id, user_metadata 
FROM storage.objects 
ORDER BY bucket_id, created_at;

Object Count by Bucket:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_objects, bucket_id 
FROM storage.objects 
GROUP BY bucket_id;
