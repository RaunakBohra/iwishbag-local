# üß™ Temporary PayPal Refund Testing (Without Edge Function)

If you want to test the refund interface while the Edge Function is being deployed, I can create a temporary mock version.

## Option 1: Use the Deployment Guide
Follow the instructions in `DEPLOY_PAYPAL_REFUND_FUNCTION.md` to deploy the real function.

## Option 2: Temporary Mock for UI Testing

If you want to test the interface immediately, I can modify the PayPal refund component to use a mock function that simulates the refund process without actually calling PayPal.

This would allow you to:
- ‚úÖ Test the refund interface
- ‚úÖ Verify the UI flows work
- ‚úÖ Test the database operations
- ‚ùå Not actually process real PayPal refunds

Would you like me to:

1. **Deploy the real function** (recommended) - Follow `DEPLOY_PAYPAL_REFUND_FUNCTION.md`
2. **Create a temporary mock** for immediate UI testing
3. **Both** - Mock first, then replace with real function

Let me know which approach you prefer!
