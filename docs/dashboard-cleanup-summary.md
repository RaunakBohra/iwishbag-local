# Dashboard Cleanup Summary

## Date: January 30, 2025

### What Was Removed from Customer Dashboard

1. **HSN Quick Test Component**
   - Removed `HSNQuickTest` component from Dashboard
   - Deleted `/src/components/dev/HSNQuickTest.tsx` file
   - This was a development-only testing tool

2. **Recent Activity Section**
   - Removed the Recent Activity timeline from Dashboard
   - Deleted `ActivityTimeline` component and its import
   - Removed the `recentActivity` data preparation logic
   - This showed recent quotes and orders but was redundant with other UI elements

3. **Notification Center**
   - Removed `NotificationCenter` component from Dashboard
   - Removed notification creation logic on dashboard load
   - Kept notification services intact as they're used elsewhere in the app

4. **User Activity Tracking**
   - Dropped `user_activity_analytics` table from database
   - Removed `UserActivityService` and all tracking calls
   - Removed activity tracking from:
     - Dashboard page visits
     - Quote creation flow
     - Product recommendations clicks
     - Add to cart actions

### Database Changes

**Migration Applied**: `20250130000015_drop_user_activity_analytics.sql`
- Dropped `user_activity_analytics` table
- Dropped related functions: `get_user_activity_summary()`, `cleanup_old_activity_data()`
- Dropped related indexes and policies

### Files Deleted
- `/src/components/dev/HSNQuickTest.tsx`
- `/src/components/dashboard/ActivityTimeline.tsx`
- `/src/services/UserActivityService.ts`

### Files Modified
- `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed all three components and related imports
- `/src/pages/QuoteRequestPage.tsx` - Removed activity tracking
- `/src/pages/dashboard/Quotes.tsx` - Removed activity tracking
- `/src/components/dashboard/RecommendedProducts.tsx` - Removed activity tracking

### Result
The customer dashboard is now cleaner and more focused on essential features:
- Quick actions for creating quotes and viewing orders
- Metric cards showing important statistics
- Product recommendations (without tracking)
- Support contact information

The dashboard loads faster and has less clutter while maintaining all core functionality.
