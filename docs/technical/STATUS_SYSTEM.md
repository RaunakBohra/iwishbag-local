# 🟢 Unified Status System – Documentation & Change Log

## Overview

This project now uses a **fully unified, dynamic status management system** for quotes and orders. All status displays, transitions, and badges are driven by a single admin-configurable source of truth, ensuring consistency, flexibility, and easy extensibility.

---

## ✨ **Key Features**

- **Admin-Configurable Statuses:**  
  All quote and order statuses (labels, colors, icons, transitions) are managed via the admin UI and stored in the database.
- **Dynamic Status Badges:**  
  The `StatusBadge` component renders all status badges with the correct color, icon, and label everywhere in the app.
- **Full Color Support:**  
  Badges now support a wide range of colors (blue, gray, red, green, yellow, purple, pink, indigo, emerald, amber, rose, violet, cyan, lime, etc.).
- **Context-Driven Performance:**  
  Status config is loaded once via a React context provider (`StatusConfigProvider`), improving performance and consistency.
- **Consistent UI:**  
  All status displays (lists, detail pages, dropdowns, progress bars, timelines) use the same config and badge component.
- **Easy Extension:**  
  Add new statuses, transitions, or colors in the admin—no code changes required.

## 🛠️ **How to Use**

### **1. Adding/Editing Statuses**
- Go to **Admin → Status Management**.
- Add, edit, or remove statuses for quotes and orders.
- Set label, color, icon, allowed transitions, and order.
- Changes are saved to the database and reflected everywhere instantly.

### **2. Using StatusBadge**
- To display a status badge:
  ```tsx
  <StatusBadge status={statusName} category="quote" />
  // or for orders:
  <StatusBadge status={statusName} category="order" />
  ```
- Props:
  - `status`: The status name (string)
  - `category`: `"quote"` or `"order"`
  - `showIcon` (optional): Show/hide the icon (default: true)

- `indigo`
- `emerald`
- `amber`
- `rose`

### **4. Status Transitions**
- Allowed transitions are configured in the admin UI.
- Transition buttons and logic use the config to determine valid next statuses.

## 📝 **Major Changes Made**

- **Unified all status logic** to use a single, dynamic config for both quotes and orders.
- **Removed all old status enums, hardcoded status names, and approval_status fields.**
- **Created a StatusConfigProvider** (React context) to load and provide status config app-wide.
- **Refactored useStatusManagement** to use the new context.
- **Updated all status-related components** (badges, filters, progress bars, timelines, admin pages) to use the new config and `StatusBadge`.
- **Added full color support** for all badge variants listed above.
- **Improved admin UX** for editing statuses, including live preview and auto-save.
- **Ensured all status transitions, analytics, and bulk actions** use the new system.
- **Improved error handling and debug logging** for status management.
- **Documented the new system** (this file).

## 📚 **Extending the System**

- **To add a new status:**  
  Use the admin UI. Pick a color, icon, and allowed transitions.
- **To add a new color:**  
  Add the color to both the admin color options and the Badge component's variants.
- **To use a status badge anywhere:**  
  Use the `StatusBadge` component as shown above.

## 🧪 **Testing**

- Change status colors, labels, and icons in the admin.
- Check all user/admin pages for correct badge display and transitions.
- Test all status transitions and workflows.
