## Status
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-17  
**Deciders:** Development Team, Technical Lead  
**Technical Story:** Phase 4.1 of Coding Excellence Initiative

---

## Context and Problem Statement

### Current Situation
The iwishBag project has grown significantly in complexity with multiple technology integrations (React, TypeScript, Supabase, payment gateways, etc.). As the team expands and the codebase evolves, we lack a systematic way to document and track significant architectural decisions.

### Business Context
- **Team Growth:** New developers need to understand architectural choices quickly
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Risk of losing institutional knowledge as team members change
- **Decision Consistency:** Need to maintain architectural coherence across features
- **Compliance:** Some decisions may have regulatory or security implications

### Technical Context
- **Complex Integrations:** Payment systems, authentication, real-time features
- **Performance Requirements:** E-commerce platform with strict performance needs
- **Security Constraints:** Handling sensitive customer and payment data
- **Scalability Planning:** Need to document decisions for future scaling

### Stakeholders
- **Development Team:** Primary users of ADRs for implementation guidance
- **Technical Leadership:** Decision makers and architectural oversight
- **New Team Members:** Benefit from documented decision context
- **Product Stakeholders:** Understanding of technical constraints and trade-offs

---

## Decision Drivers

- **Knowledge Management:** Preserve institutional knowledge and decision rationale
- **Team Efficiency:** Reduce time spent re-discussing settled architectural decisions
- **Onboarding Speed:** Accelerate new team member understanding of system architecture
- **Decision Quality:** Improve decision-making through structured analysis
- **Accountability:** Clear ownership and rationale for architectural choices
- **Compliance:** Document security and regulatory decision compliance
- **Maintenance:** Enable informed evolution of architectural decisions over time

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: No Formal Process
**Description:** Continue with informal documentation and tribal knowledge

**Pros:**
- No additional overhead or process burden
- Maximum flexibility in decision-making
- No learning curve for new process

**Cons:**
- Knowledge loss when team members leave
- Repeated discussions on settled topics
- Inconsistent architectural decisions
- Difficult onboarding for new developers
- Risk of architectural drift

**Cost/Effort:** Low (no change)

### Option 2: Lightweight ADR Process
**Description:** Implement a structured but lightweight ADR process with markdown documents

**Pros:**
- Preserves institutional knowledge
- Structured decision-making process
- Version-controlled documentation
- Low barrier to entry (markdown)
- Integrates with existing Git workflow
- Industry standard approach

**Cons:**
- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires team training and adoption
- Need to maintain ADR quality over time

**Cost/Effort:** Medium (initial setup and ongoing maintenance)

### Option 3: Heavy Architectural Governance
**Description:** Implement comprehensive architectural review boards and detailed documentation

**Pros:**
- Maximum rigor in decision-making
- Comprehensive documentation
- Strong governance and oversight

**Cons:**
- High overhead and bureaucracy
- Slows down development velocity
- May discourage experimentation
- Over-engineering for current team size

**Cost/Effort:** High (significant process and time investment)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 2 - Lightweight ADR Process

### Rationale
The lightweight ADR process provides the optimal balance between documentation benefits and process overhead. It addresses our core needs for knowledge preservation and decision consistency while maintaining development agility suitable for our current team size and project stage.

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Create ADR template and process documentation**
2. **Establish review workflow integrated with GitHub**
3. **Train team on ADR creation and review process**
4. **Start with retrospective ADRs for major existing decisions**
5. **Integrate ADR creation into development workflow**

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Preserved Knowledge:** Architectural decisions and rationale documented for future reference
- **Improved Onboarding:** New team members can understand system architecture faster
- **Better Decisions:** Structured analysis leads to more thoughtful architectural choices
- **Reduced Repetition:** Avoid re-discussing previously settled architectural questions
- **Architectural Consistency:** Clear guidance for maintaining system coherence
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Clear documentation for explaining technical decisions

### Negative Consequences
- **Documentation Overhead:** Additional time required for creating and maintaining ADRs
- **Process Learning Curve:** Team needs to learn and adopt new documentation process
- **Maintenance Responsibility:** Need to keep ADRs current and relevant over time
- **Potential Bureaucracy:** Risk of process becoming too heavy if not managed carefully

### Neutral Consequences
- **Change in Workflow:** Development process includes ADR consideration for major decisions
- **Review Process:** Addition of architectural review step for significant changes
- **Tool Integration:** ADRs become part of documentation and knowledge management

---

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements
- **Documentation Location:** `docs/adr/` directory in project repository
- **Format:** Markdown files with standardized template
- **Naming Convention:** Sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)
- **Version Control:** Git-based with pull request review process

### Dependencies
- **Team Training:** All developers need to understand ADR process
- **Review Workflow:** Integration with existing code review process
- **Template Creation:** Standardized template for consistent ADR format

### Migration Strategy
1. **Document Process:** Create comprehensive ADR process documentation
2. **Retrospective ADRs:** Document major existing architectural decisions
3. **Team Training:** Conduct ADR workshop and process training
4. **Gradual Adoption:** Start with major decisions, expand to broader usage

### Testing Strategy
- **Process Validation:** Create sample ADRs to validate template and process
- **Team Feedback:** Collect feedback on ADR creation and review experience
- **Continuous Improvement:** Refine process based on usage experience

### Rollback Plan
If the ADR process proves too burdensome:
1. **Simplify Template:** Reduce required sections for faster creation
2. **Adjust Scope:** Limit ADRs to only the most significant decisions
3. **Archive Process:** Maintain existing ADRs but stop creating new ones

---

## Monitoring and Success Criteria

### Key Metrics
- **ADR Creation Rate:** Target 1-2 ADRs per month for significant decisions
- **Team Adoption:** 100% of team trained and creating ADRs for major decisions
- **Decision Quality:** Reduced time spent on architectural re-discussions
- **Onboarding Efficiency:** Faster new team member architectural understanding

### Monitoring Approach
- **Monthly Reviews:** Assess ADR creation and quality in team retrospectives
- **Process Feedback:** Regular team feedback on ADR process effectiveness
- **Usage Analytics:** Track ADR creation, updates, and reference frequency

### Review Schedule
- **3-Month Review:** Assess initial adoption and process effectiveness
- **6-Month Review:** Evaluate long-term sustainability and benefits
- **Annual Review:** Comprehensive process assessment and improvement planning

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Team resistance to documentation overhead | Medium | Medium | Start with simple template, demonstrate value through examples |
| ADRs become outdated and irrelevant | High | Medium | Regular review schedule, integration with development workflow |
| Process becomes too bureaucratic | Low | High | Keep template lightweight, focus on value over compliance |
| Inconsistent ADR quality | Medium | Low | Provide examples, peer review process, template guidance |
