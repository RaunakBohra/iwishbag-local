# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the iwishBag project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, options considered, and consequences to help maintain architectural consistency and provide historical context for future development.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- **Document reasoning** behind architectural choices
- **Provide context** for future developers
- **Track evolution** of system architecture
- **Enable informed decisions** by understanding past choices
- **Reduce repetitive discussions** about settled decisions

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that are:

### ‚úÖ **Require ADR:**
- **Technology stack changes** (new frameworks, libraries, databases)
- **Architectural pattern adoption** (microservices, event-driven, etc.)
- **Security model decisions** (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- **Data architecture changes** (database schema, data flow, storage strategy)
- **API design decisions** (REST vs GraphQL, versioning strategy)
- **Performance optimization strategies** (caching, CDN, optimization techniques)
- **Third-party service integrations** (payment gateways, analytics, monitoring)
- **Development workflow changes** (CI/CD, testing strategy, deployment)
- **Compliance requirements** (GDPR, PCI DSS, accessibility standards)

### ‚ùå **Do NOT require ADR:**
- **Minor implementation details** (variable naming, small refactoring)
- **Tactical bug fixes** (unless they require architectural changes)
- **UI/UX changes** (unless they affect system architecture)
- **Configuration updates** (environment variables, feature flags)
- **Documentation updates** (README changes, code comments)

## ADR Lifecycle

### Status Options
- **üü° Proposed** - Decision is under consideration
- **üü¢ Accepted** - Decision has been approved and is being implemented
- **üîµ Implemented** - Decision has been fully implemented
- **üü† Deprecated** - Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **üî¥ Superseded** - Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

### Review Process
1. **Draft** - Author creates initial ADR draft
2. **Review** - Team reviews and provides feedback
3. **Discussion** - Address concerns and iterate on proposal
4. **Decision** - Final approval by architecture review board
5. **Implementation** - Execute the architectural decision
6. **Follow-up** - Monitor consequences and update as needed

## Directory Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template.md              # ADR template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0001-adr-process.md      # Meta-ADR about this process
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0002-technology-stack.md # Technology stack decisions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0003-database-choice.md  # Database architecture decisions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                      # Additional ADRs numbered sequentially
```

## Naming Convention

ADRs should be named using the following pattern:
```
NNNN-brief-description.md
```

Where:
- `NNNN` is a 4-digit sequential number (0001, 0002, etc.)
- `brief-description` is a short, kebab-case description of the decision

Examples:
- `0001-adopt-adr-process.md`
- `0002-choose-react-typescript.md`
- `0003-implement-supabase-backend.md`

## Quick Start

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/NNNN-your-decision.md
   ```

2. **Fill out the template** with your architectural decision

3. **Create a pull request** for team review

4. **Address feedback** and iterate as needed

5. **Get approval** from the architecture review board

6. **Merge and implement** the decision

### Reviewing ADRs

When reviewing ADRs, consider:
- **Clarity** - Is the problem and solution clearly explained?
- **Alternatives** - Were other options properly considered?
- **Consequences** - Are both positive and negative impacts identified?
- **Implementation** - Is the decision feasible and practical?
- **Alignment** - Does it align with existing architecture and goals?

## Architecture Review Board

### Current Members
- **Lead Developer** - Primary technical decision maker
- **Senior Developer** - Technical expertise and implementation feasibility
- **Product Owner** - Business requirements and user impact
- **DevOps Engineer** - Infrastructure and deployment considerations

### Decision Criteria
Decisions are evaluated based on:
1. **Technical Merit** - Is it technically sound and implementable?
2. **Business Value** - Does it support business objectives?
3. **Risk Assessment** - What are the potential risks and mitigations?
4. **Resource Impact** - What are the time, cost, and effort implications?
5. **Strategic Alignment** - Does it align with long-term technical strategy?

## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs
- **Be concise but complete** - Include necessary details without verbosity
- **Use clear language** - Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
- **Include diagrams** - Visual representations help understanding
- **Reference sources** - Link to relevant documentation, research, or examples
- **Update status** - Keep the status current as decisions evolve

### Maintaining ADRs
- **Regular reviews** - Periodically review ADRs for relevance
- **Update consequences** - Document actual outcomes and lessons learned
- **Link related ADRs** - Reference related decisions and superseded ADRs
- **Archive obsolete ADRs** - Mark as deprecated or superseded when appropriate

## Integration with Development Workflow

### GitHub Integration
- **Pull Request Templates** - Include ADR checklist for significant changes
- **Branch Naming** - Use `adr/brief-description` for ADR-related branches
- **Labels** - Use `architectural-decision` label for ADR pull requests

### Documentation Links
- **README Updates** - Link to relevant ADRs in project documentation
- **Code Comments** - Reference ADR numbers in code implementing decisions
- **Architecture Diagrams** - Include ADR references in system diagrams

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- **Markdown** - Standard format for ADR documents
- **Mermaid** - For creating diagrams within markdown
- **PlantUML** - Alternative diagramming tool
- **ADR Tools** - Command-line tools for ADR management

## FAQ

### How detailed should ADRs be?
ADRs should be detailed enough for someone to understand the decision context and rationale without being overly verbose. Aim for 1-3 pages typically.

### Can ADRs be changed after approval?
ADRs should be immutable once accepted. If changes are needed, create a new ADR that supersedes the previous one, explaining what changed and why.

### Who can propose ADRs?
Any team member can propose an ADR. However, significant architectural decisions should involve senior team members and follow the review process.

### How often should we review ADRs?
Conduct quarterly reviews of ADRs to assess their continued relevance and document any changes in consequences or implementation status.
