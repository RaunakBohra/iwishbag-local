# Stripe Customer Details Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
I've enhanced the Stripe integration to send and receive comprehensive customer details, addressing the user's request to "check if we grabbing and sending full details we can send and receive like name address and others to and from Stripe."

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Payment Creation (`create-payment/index.ts`)
- **New File**: `create-payment/stripe-enhanced.ts` - Contains the enhanced Stripe payment creation logic
- **Customer Details Collection**: Extracts customer information from quotes and user input
- **Stripe Customer Management**: Creates or updates Stripe Customer records for repeat purchases
- **Enhanced Payment Intent**: Includes shipping address, billing details, and metadata

### 2. Enhanced Payment Form (`StripePaymentForm.tsx`)
- **Customer Info Props**: Added `customerInfo` interface for passing customer details
- **Billing Address Collection**: Configured PaymentElement to collect billing details
- **Pre-filled Fields**: Customer name, email, phone, and address are pre-populated
- **Address Validation**: Ensures complete address information is sent to Stripe

### 3. Enhanced Checkout Integration (`Checkout.tsx`)
- **Customer Data Assembly**: Combines guest contact info and shipping address
- **Dynamic Info Passing**: Passes customer details to StripePaymentForm
- **Address Completion Check**: Ensures address is complete before payment

### 4. Enhanced Webhook Processing (`stripe-webhook/index.ts`)
- **Customer Details Extraction**: Captures customer info from payment intents and charges
- **Enhanced Gateway Response**: Stores customer details in payment transactions
- **Quote Updates**: Updates quotes with customer information from Stripe
- **Billing Details Storage**: Captures billing details from successful charges

### 5. Testing and Monitoring
- **Test Script**: `test-enhanced-stripe-flow.ts` - Verifies customer details flow
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging for customer data capture and processing

## Customer Details Now Sent to Stripe

### 1. Payment Intent Creation
```typescript
{
  amount: amountInSmallestUnit,
  currency: currency.toLowerCase(),
  customer: stripeCustomer.id,           // Customer record
  receipt_email: customerEmail,          // Email for receipt
  shipping: {                            // Shipping address
    name: customerName,
    phone: customerPhone,
    address: {
      line1: address.line1,
      city: address.city,
      state: address.state,
      postal_code: address.postal_code,
      country: address.country
    }
  },
  metadata: {                            // Additional info
    customer_name: customerName,
    customer_phone: customerPhone,
    quote_ids: quoteIds.join(','),
    user_id: userId
  }
}
```

### 2. Stripe Customer Record
```typescript
{
  email: customerEmail,
  name: customerName,
  phone: customerPhone,
  address: shippingAddress,
  metadata: {
    user_id: userId,
    last_quote_id: quoteId
  }
}
```

### 3. PaymentElement Configuration
```typescript
{
  fields: {
    billingDetails: {
      name: 'auto',
      email: 'auto', 
      phone: 'auto',
      address: {
        line1: 'auto',
        city: 'auto',
        state: 'auto',
        country: 'auto',
        postalCode: 'auto'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Customer Details Now Received from Stripe

### 1. Payment Intent Webhook
- Customer email, name, phone from metadata
- Shipping address from shipping object
- Customer ID for future reference
- Receipt email for confirmations

### 2. Charge Webhook
- Billing details from customer input
- Receipt URL for customer records
- Full address information
- Payment method details

### 3. Enhanced Storage
```typescript
// In payment_transactions.gateway_response
{
  ...originalPaymentIntent,
  customer_details: {
    email: paymentIntent.receipt_email,
    name: paymentIntent.shipping?.name || metadata.customer_name,
    phone: paymentIntent.shipping?.phone || metadata.customer_phone,
    shipping_address: paymentIntent.shipping?.address,
    billing_details: charge.billing_details,
    customer_id: paymentIntent.customer
  },
  charge_details: {
    billing_details: charge.billing_details,
    receipt_email: charge.receipt_email,
    receipt_url: charge.receipt_url
  }
