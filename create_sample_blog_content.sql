  '# Understanding International Shipping Costs and Customs Duties

When shopping internationally, understanding shipping costs and customs duties is crucial for calculating your total purchase cost. This guide breaks down everything you need to know.

## Components of International Shipping Costs

### 1. Base Shipping Cost
This is the fundamental cost to transport your package internationally:
- **Express Shipping**: 3-5 business days, higher cost
- **Standard Shipping**: 7-14 business days, moderate cost
- **Economy Shipping**: 14-30 business days, lowest cost

### 2. Handling Fees

(Length × Width × Height) ÷ 5000 = Volumetric Weight in kg

### Example:
- Package dimensions: 40cm × 30cm × 20cm

- Actual weight: 2 kg
- **Chargeable weight**: 4.8 kg (higher of the two)
